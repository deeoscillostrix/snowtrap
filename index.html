								SnowTrap was adopted from Crazetopher David Blazing III's lawn
								by Oscillo Strix in May 2009. He suddenly gained mobility in May
								2013 overnight - to this day, nobody (not even SnowTrap himself)
								knows how he gained this ability.

							<p class="card-text">
								Like other fellow plants of his species, he hates puns related
								to the cold - "stay frosty", "chill out", you name it. He just
								requires generous amounts of sunlight, high-fiber CO<sub>2</sub>
								and lots of water to sustain himself in your average non-snowy
								climate. Luckily for him, most regard him as cute for a
								bizarrely sentient species of flora. "I'm perfectly okay with
								that," he assures. As for his fellow junior plants, they regard
								him as a dependable and kind big brother figure to them.
							</p>

							<p class="card-text">
								Currently, he remains close with his adopter, tending to the
								house garden often and accompanying each other in many, many
								adventures. When asked about his relationship with the odd owl,
								he just shrugged and said, "I'm just besties with him. What more
								were you expecting?"
							</p>

							<p class="card-text">
								Interestingly for a plant belonging to the Winter-mint family,
								he loves the color orange, hence his snow hat themed after an
								orange lolly. There exist rumors pointing to him having a
								possible connection to the plant renegade hero known as "The
								Tangerine Mist".
